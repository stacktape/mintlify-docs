# Prerequisites

To deploy a git project using Stacktape:

1. You must have a Stacktape account. If you don't have an account, please
   [sign up](https://console.stacktape.com/sign-up)

2. You must have an AWS account connected to your Stacktape organization. Connecting your account takes ~2 minutes. You
   can connect the account on [AWS accounts page in the console](https://console.stacktape.com/aws-accounts)

# 1 - Create new Stacktape project

After signing in to the console, click on `Deploy new project` and select `Git project using console`.

alphanumeric dash case.

## 2.1 - Configure stage details

Configure your environment details:

1. **Branch** - branch to use for deployment,
2. **Commit** - commit to use for initial deployment,
3. **Stage** - arbitrary alphanumeric dash-case string. For example, `production`, `staging` or `john-dev`.
4. **AWS Account** - select an AWS account connected to your Stacktape organization.
5. If your repository does NOT contain a stacktape template (`stacktape.yml` or `stacktape.ts`), choose **Create new
   infrastructure configuration**.

## 2.2 - Create Stacktape configuration

1.  **(Recommended)** Use the [interactive config editor](https://console.stacktape.com/template-editor). To learn about
    how to use it, head over to [using the config editor](/getting-started/using-config-editor).

2.  Use a [starter projects](/getting-started/starter-project) with a pre-configured Stacktape configuration.

3.  Follow one of the step-by-step tutorials. Currenctly available tutorials are
    [Fullstack Next.js T3 app](/tutorials/t3-nextjs-app) and [Web API](/tutorials/web-api).

4.  Write the config manually. To make this process easier, you can install
    [Stacktape VScode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stacktape.vscode-stacktape).

## 2.3 - Deploy

When your template is ready, click on the `Deploy now` button.

![Start the deployment](/static/getting-started/first-deploy/docscode4.png)
